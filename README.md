# qb-blackmarket

Hello.

I made the script by emulating ik. I wanted to develop it a little more and present it to you. You can rearrange the features and different items in it from the config file.
On the bottom line, you can see and change how many minutes the black seller will move.

ChangeLocationTime = 1

You can put the items you want in Products. I'll give you one line to add:

[17] = { name = "itemname", price = , crypto = 1,amount = 5 },

As a location, you can add a new code to the codes below.
["coords"] = {
[1] = vector4(776.24, 4184.08, 41.8, 92.12),
[2] = vector4(2482.51, 3722.28, 43.92, 39.98),
[3] = vector4(462.67, -1789.16, 28.59, 317.53),
[4] = vector4(-115.15, 6369.07, 31.52, 232.08),
[5] = vector4(752.52, -3198.33, 6.07, 301.72)
},

ChangeLocationTime = 1
